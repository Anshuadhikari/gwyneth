Homebase is a web-based application that provides database and scheduling support
for Gwyneth's Gift Foundation, a local non-profit in Fredericksburg, VA. 

Credits: Homebase was originally developed in 2008 by Oliver Radwan, Maxwell Palmer, Nolan
McNair, Taylor Talmage, and Allen Tucker for the Ronald McDonald Houses in Maineand Rhode
Island. Since then, it has been significantly upgraded by other student teams and is
currently maintained by NPFI (https://npfi.org). The version of homebase contained within
this repository was built upon the NPFI legacy code, and its development was catered to the
needs of Gwyneth's Gift Foundation staff members.
