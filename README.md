# Gwyneth's Gift Volunteer Management System (VMS)
## Purpose
This project is the result of two semesters' worth of collaboration among UMW students. The goal of the project was to create a web application that the Gwyneth's Gift organization could utlize to make managing volunteers and organizing events easier. At-a-glance features include a web-based calendar of events, event sign up, volunteer registration & login system, reporting system, and basic notification system.

## Authors
The VMS is based on an old open source project named "Homebase". [Homebase](https://a.link.will.go.here/) was originally developed for the Ronald McDonald Houses in Maineand Rhode Island by Oliver Radwan, Maxwell Palmer, Nolan McNair, Taylor Talmage, and Allen Tucker. A major overhaul to the existing system took place this semester, throwing out and restructuring many of the existing database tables. Very little original Homebase code remains.

Modifications to the original Homebase code were made by the previous semester's group of students. That team consisted of TEAM MEMBERS LIST HERE.

The major overhaul took place in the Spring 2023 semester. This team consisted of Lauren Knight, Zack Burnley, Matt Nguyen, Rishi Shankar, Alip Yalikun, and Tamra Arant. Every page and feature of the app was changed by this team.

## Potential Improvements
Below is a list of improvements that could be made to the system in subsequent semesters.
* The system could generate emails and send them to users (would require access to an @gwynethsgift.org email address)
* The notification system could be turned into a full-fledged messaging system
  * The existing dbMessages table is set up to allow this
* Reports
  * Additional reports could be added
  * Visual components could be added (graphs)
  * Client originally requested a reports dashboard with at-a-glance information available
*
